## Getting Started - Local setup

### 0. Prerequisites

To run this demo locally, you'll need the following:

- a [Supabase account](https://supabase.com)
- an [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/)

You are all set, your database is ready to be used!

## Demo tour

This template is shipped with a Database seed containing three blog posts (two drafts) and two workflows.

Here are some suggestions of steps to follow as a tour of this demo:

### 1. Configuring an automation

1. Navigate to the automation tab
1. Click "Configure" on the "When a blog post is moved to review" automation
1. Hover the "blog-post.updated" node to click on the "+" icon
1. Select "Add a Table of Contents" on the right side panel

1. Finally, add a "Apply changes after approval" as a final step
1. Click on "Save changes" at the top right

### 2. Move a blog post to review

We now have an active automation that will trigger when a blog post moves to review.

Let's trigger our automation:

1. Navigate to the blog posts page
1. Click on "Send to review" on the draft blog post
1. Navigate to your [Inngest Dev Server](http://localhost:8288) or [Inngest Platform](https://app.inngest.com/?ref=github-workflow-kit-example-nextjs-blog-cms-readme) and go over the "Runs" tab
1. You can now see your automation running live, step by step, to finally pause
1. Return to the demo app, the blog post should have the "Needs approval" status. Click on "Review" and compare the Original blog post with the AI revision using the tabs.
1. At the bottom, click on the "Approve suggestions & Publish" button
1. Back on the Runs page of the [Inngest Dev Server](http://localhost:8288) or [Inngest Platform](https://app.inngest.com/?ref=github-workflow-kit-example-nextjs-blog-cms-readme), you see the workflow in a completed state.
1. Going back to the demo application, on the "blog posts" tab, the blog post should be flagged as "Published"
